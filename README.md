This is my main mono-repo for my personal project

This includes my personal website, and links to actual working projects and progressions.

The main thing that I'm currently working on is my **Liar's Dice** application:

---

## Liar's Dice is a classic bluffing game that is popular during karaoke sessions in Asian culture, as well as a drinking game

I have found this game particularly engaging because it does not rely solely on luck. It tests the trust between players, offering opportunities for enjoyable and memorable interactions, as well as strategic targeting.

### In addition to the classic ruleset, you can modify the game with house rules, making it highly adaptable

There are numerous ways to play, and I aim to introduce and accommodate each variation. The game differs across cultures and households, showcasing its flexibility and universal appeal.
